    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know to get started",
    "generateQuestion": "What does \"Generate\" mean?",
    "generateAnswer": "Generate means creating a new wallet account. The system automatically generates 12 secret words (mnemonic phrase) that constitute your unique identifier and password. These 12 words are the only key to access your tokens. Write them down carefully on paper and keep them safe.",
    "importQuestion": "What does \"Import\" mean?",
    "importAnswer": "Import allows you to restore an existing account using your 12 secret words that you noted during creation. If you already have a wallet and change devices, use \"Import\" with your 12 words to regain access to your tokens.",
    "whyConnectQuestion": "Why connect?",
    "whyConnectAnswer": "Connection (via Generate or Import) is necessary to interact with your tokens: buy farm tokens, pay your producers, receive payments, and check your balances. Without connection, you can only browse the farm directory.",
    "safetyQuestion": "Are my 12 words safe?",
    "safetyAnswer": "Your 12 words are stored locally on your device. No one else has access to them. However, if you lose your 12 words AND clear your browser, you permanently lose access to your tokens. That's why it's crucial to write them down on paper.",
    "costQuestion": "Are there any fees?",
    "costAnswer": "Transactions on the eCash network require minimal fees (less than a cent for 100 transactions). For your farm token purchases, conditions are defined by each producer.",
    "verifiedStatusQuestion": "What do the \"Verified\" and \"Unverified\" statuses mean?",
    "verifiedStatusAnswer": "A \"Verified\" farm has validated its identity (KYC) and confirmed its agricultural activity this year with the platform. An \"Unverified\" farm is free but has not yet provided these guarantees.",
    "whyKycQuestion": "Why does a farm need to validate its identity (KYC)?",
    "whyKycAnswer": "This guarantees users that the farm actually exists and is still active. This verification is renewed annually.",
